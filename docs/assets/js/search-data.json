Also what feature caused that and make desicions based on this information.\n\n## Profiling with ClinicJS\n\n### Flame\n\n- The function on the bottom is the function on-CPU. The higher up the y-axis, the further nested the function.\n- The width of each function on the graph represents the amount of time it took that function to execute as a percentage of the total time of its parent function.\n- Finding functions that are both high on the y-axis (deeply nested) and wide on the x-axis (time-intensive) is a great way to narrow down performance and optimization

(The other tools are partly offering this now, too.) It is also focused on development scenarios in cloud-based Kubernetes environments. In contrast to this, Tilt is rather specialized on development with local Kubernetes environments, while Telepresence enables the development of a locally running application that can interact with other parts running remotely.

This can be a cost bases solution.\n\nPresent an example of migration to have the provition capacity and then lower it down.\nWhen doing that since there was created many partitions during the migration process and then when lowering down, we found out that the Read and Write capacity is smaller for each partititons since the provision capacity is divided in the number of partitions.\n\nDynamodb does not allocate everything or reduce in 1 partitions. partitions will remain. Increasing our cost 6 times\n\nThe best practice will be to distribute data using ´partition key to write simultanipously on dynamodb.\n\n### DynamoDb keys\n\nPrimary keys\n\nstay away scan operations\n\nfilters are made after the data was getted\n\nmax local secondary indexes: 5\n\nglobal seco\n\n![image-20191126153939760](./assets/images/image-20191126153939760.png)\n\n### Hot keys or Partitions\n\nHot keys: when certain keys has information that is going to use data from 1 partition often thatn others for example when we get recent data.\n\nWe can move recent data to other table.\n\nor use DAX as cache\n\n### Design patterns\n\n![image-20191126171249941](./assets/images/image-20191126171249941.png)\n\n## Summary\n\nDynamoDB offers a bunch of features that you can use to start an application with minimal set up. Worry less about scaling, sharding, and put your application running in short time. Also you are in AWS Ecosystem that can bring many benefits. For large-scale applications, there is some things to take into consideration.\n\n- An really good estimation of R/W operatations for our database. In other words be able to predict concurrency and storage which impacts in the **provision capacity** that we need to set up at the beginning, we can modify it later but we can get into unexpected incresing in costs and slowing down every partition created since the **provision capacity** will be divided on each one.\n- Be able to predict how to deal with **hot keys and partitions**, In case we have keys refering data that will be used often than others will end up on using a single partition instead of all tje partitions available. Increasing cost, and delay. As a solution you can \"archived\" some data and move it to other table, in that way you will only worry for the latest data. This startegy needs planning and play with a lot of variables.\n- There is an alternative that Amazon provides adding a layer Using DAX, with it you can redirect incomming request in a way that can lower down the consuption of a single partition and distribute incomming R/W operations over all partitions. This alternative will increase the cost for being an aditional service.\n- queries stron cosnistency and eventually reads\n- index\n- tenancy\n- chech wiki adsk\n\n## Usefull Links\n\n- [performance-metrics](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/top-dynamodb-performance-metrics/)\n- [11-things-before-start](https://blog.yugabyte.com/11-things-you-wish-you-knew-before-starting-with-dynamodb/)\n- [dynamo-is-not-for-everybody](https://read.acloud.guru/why-amazon-dynamodb-isnt-for-everyone-and-how-to-decide-when-it-s-for-you-aefc52ea9476?gi=d300d4ccd949)\n- [back-to-rds](https://blog.codebarrel.io/why-we-switched-from-dynamodb-back-to-rds-before-we-even-released-3c2ee092120c?gi=b30f9bb06d99)\n- [understanding-scaling-behaviour](https://theburningmonk.com/2019/03/understanding-the-scaling-behaviour-of-dynamodb-ondemand-tables/)\n\n- Youtube: [AWS re:Invent 2018: Amazon DynamoDB Deep Dive: Advanced Design Patterns for DynamoDB (DAT401)\n  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaEPXoXVf2k)\n\nlet's say that you are forced to increase the PC to handle more R/W operations during black friday and return to the previous value after that event, as a result you will end up with more partitions which is fine when the value was higher but the we can\n","url":"https://mzavaletavargas.github.io/test/notes/3e389eed-da91-4a54-bd83-2645161e58e0.html","relUrl":"notes/3e389eed-da91-4a54-bd83-2645161e58e0.html"},{"doc":"Networking","title":"Networking","hpath":"networking","content":"\n","url":"https://mzavaletavargas.github.io/test/notes/4ad54c56-c118-4c77-b7a7-704b6e57579c.html","relUrl":"notes/4ad54c56-c118-4c77-b7a7-704b6e57579c.html"},{"doc":"Nginx","title":"Nginx","hpath":"networking.nginx","content":"\n## What is it?\n\nNGINX is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, software load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.\n\nNginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests.[22] Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide more predictable performance under high loads.\n\nDefinition by: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx\n\nhttp://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html\n\n## Why do we need this web server?\n\n- Higher performance serving static files\n- SSL/TLS termination\n- Be a first layer for security.\n\nhttps://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/application-server-vs-web-server/\n[When using node.js, do you still need Nginx or Apache?](https://www.quora.com/When-using-node-js-do-you-still-need-Nginx-or-Apache)\n\n### Avoid running our Node.js app on port 80\n\nOn linux environments root access is needed to use the ports <= 1024\n\nWe are exposed, attackers can find the way to run commands for them using root privileges.\n\nUse a web server that has reverse proxy instead, in other words use NGINX.\n\n## Reverse proxy\n\nReverse Proxy get all the incoming request, do a bunch of operations for us, and response back to the client.\n\n[Use NGINX as a Reverse Proxy](https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/nginx/use-nginx-reverse-proxy/)\n\n[Jenkins with NGINX - Reverse proxy with https](https://medium.com/@sportans300/nginx-reverse-proxy-with-https-466daa4da4fc)\n\n## Load Balancer\n\nDistributes workload among our servers preventing overloading, continue serving to clients even if one of the nodes shut down, increase server capacity.\n\nComparation load balancer performance, cluster module, iptables, nginx\nhttps://medium.com/@fermads/node-js-process-load-balancing-comparing-cluster-iptables-and-nginx-6746aaf38272\n\nhttps://github.com/fermads/node.js-process-load-balancing\n\n[How to load Balancing NodeJs apps using Nginx?](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)\n\n```\nReverse proxy servers and load balancers are components in a client-server computing architecture.
