After listening and reading about logging with kubernetes, many podacasts, blogs, and other onine resources suggested datadog, so I decided to take a look an test it for my work project. It end up really good. I recieve all the input from [[FluentBit  | operating-systems.kubernetes.logging#fluent-bit]].
